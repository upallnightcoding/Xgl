## Introduction

Xgl is the integration language used by the Xg Game Engine.  It is a free format language that resembles "c-Language" and "Java" syntax.  

Xgl is not a compiled or interpreted language, but is translated into a in-memory tree structured that can be executed.  The tree structure can actually be created by translated the Xgl code or programmatically by invoking the correct library classes to build the in-memory code.

## First Program - Hello World

The first program that we will execute is the proverbial "Hello, World."

```
program;
  print "Hello, World!";
end;
```

## Variables & Types

Xgl supports standard variable names.  All variable names must begin with a letter, either "a" through "z" or "A" through "Z".  The name can then contain, numbers "0" through "9", or "_".  Any other characters are not allowed.  Variables in Xgl are **not** case sensitive.  Therefore, the variables ~~CAR~~, ~car~, ~Car~, ~caR~ are all equal and will reference the same variable.  Keywords are not allowed to be used as variables.

Examples of legal variable names:
Priority1
start
two_weeks
